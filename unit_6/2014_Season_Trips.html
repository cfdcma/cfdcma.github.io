						<p>Canyons Resort, now part of Park City Mountain, is a quick 45 minute drive from Salt Lake City. Located in Park City, Utah, home to the 2002 Winter Olympics, there is as much to do off the slops in Park City and in Utah Olympic Park as there is skiing on the slopes. The local art scene and shopping available in Park City will occipy any non-skiers in your crew. When you need to rest your legs and lung, spend the day exploring Utah Olympic Park. Canyons trails cater to everyone's experience with plenty of greens and blues for the learning and improving skiiers. Black and double black diamonds serve up challenges for those who want to push limits with steeps descents and bumpy mogels. Many swooping trails wind their way through and around on-mountain homes giving skiers a close up of some stunning local properties.
