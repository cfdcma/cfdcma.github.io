		<h1> 2016 Season Trips</h2>

			<p>In 2016, the ski trips all centered around resorts that participated in the <a href="https://www.themaxpass.com/"> M.A.X Pass</a>
			offerings. From the northeast to the west coast and even the Rockies the options were plentiful with no overlap on the Epic pass. 
			With so many new choices there was a lot of new mountains to take advantage of and explore.

					<h3><a href="http://www.sundayriver.com/">Sunday River</a></h3>
					<img src="./images/SundayRiver16b.jpg" alt="Stormy ski day" title="Snowy, snowy day on the slopes">
					<p>In north central Maine, Sunday River sits as the sixth largest mountains in New England and one of the few northeast offerings on the M.A.X. Pass. With some of the best snow making technology in the northeast and upgraded lifts, it is a perfect for a ski weekend getaway. Fair warning, northern Maine can bring the cold so pack the woolies and be prepared for some classic northeast ice. Six miles away is Bethel- a quintessential New England town with a historic village of shops and restaurants.

					<h3><a href="http://squawalpine.com/">Squaw Valley</a></h3>
					<img src="./images/SqauwValley16.jpg" alt="Olympic Rings" title="Sqauw Valley, Home of 1960 Winter Olympics">
					<p>Squaw Valley proudly hosted the 1960 Olympics and still displays Olympic markers. Breathtaking scenery and sunny skis provide the motivation to tackle the 170 trails at Squaw. Views of Lake Tahoe compel skiers and riders alike to the summit for photos. If you are looking for fast skiing and zippy turns then add Squaw Valley to your list. Lodging at the base ease the planning logistics and the village has every thing you might need for a ski getaway with many winter activities after the trails close. Don't forget to visit Squaw Valley's sister resort Alpine Meadows minutes away.</p>

					<h3> <a href="http://squawalpine.com/">Alpine Meadows</a></h3>
					<img src="./images/AlpineMeadows16.jpg" alt="Chairlift queue" title="Lift Queue of Canines and People">
					<p>Alpine Meadows located on the north side of Lake Tahoe and a sister resort to Squaw Valley is a complete gem. A favorite among locals with a family feel, Alpine caters to intermediate and advanced skiers. With 7 bowls and 2400 skiable acres the terrain caters to those who like steep groomers to the more adventurous who want to make fresh turns. With a vertical drop of 1802 feet, avalanches are a risk and ski patrol keeps a close watch.</p>

					<h3> <a href="https://bigskyresort.com/">Big Sky</a></h3>
					<img src="./images/BigSky16b.jpg" alt="Big Sky Powder Day" title="Jumping out of Deep Snow in the Trees">
					<p>Big Sky is aptly named and a complete joy of a ski resort. 5800 acres offers all skiers the choice to stay in their comfort zone or the opportunity to explore new terrain. Take the tram to the summit for a view as far as the eye can see. When there's fresh powder there are turns for days. After a full day on the mountain you can try out the local Beehive Basin Brewery for a tasting or a growler to go. While a truly enormous mountain Big Sky still has a small-town local feel. Big Sky will not disappoint but pack some warm layers for cold mornings and late afternoons!</p>
